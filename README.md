# i-numeri-italiani
This is a Node Express app that translates Italian numbers 1 - 9999 programmatically. CSS and JS files are concatenated and minified using the Gulp task runner. Gulp also runs the Mocha and Chai tests that make sure the translation function works correctly.

## To install:
1. Clone or fork the repo from Github.
2. You must have Node and Sass installed.
3. Install nodemon to run the server. ```npm install -g nodemon```
4. Run the command ```npm install``` from inside the project folder to install
the dependencies.`
7. Start the server with nodemon: ```nodemon app.js```
8. Run ```gulp browser-sync```

This last command initiates the concatenation and minification of the CSS and JS files (at this time there is only one JS file, but Iâ€™m putting it through the Gulp minifcation and concatenation process because I may add more in the future). This process will create CSS and JS folders and their associated files in the app folder. I have the .gitignore file set up so they do not get committed to version control.

**Future Development:**

Next steps: This little project was made back in 2015/2016 and a lot has changed in the JS ecosystem since that time. I also know quite a bit more than I did back then. My plan is to resurrect this site in Dec 22/Jan 23, completely refactor and restyle it, and deploy it with Netflify. (There's no need for it to have an Express backend. I only built it that way to practice when I was first learning how to use Node.)
